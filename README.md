# gee_monkey

Batch export Google Earth Engine (GEE) tasks with `Tampermonkey`.

+ Tired of click GEE tasks run button in browser? 
+ Tired of translate `JavaScript` into `python`, because of `JavaScript` inconvenient batch exporting? 
+ Tired of paste JavaScript into console?  

__Tampermonkey can solve those problems!__

## Functions
- **rALL** : batch run all tasks
- **cALL** : cancel all tasks
- **cSUB** : only cancel `submitted-to-backend` tasks, and leave `running-on-backend` tasks to be continue

**Tasks submitted to GEE have two kinds:**   
1. `task submitted-to-backend`: just submitted and waiting in the queue  
2. `task running-on-backend`: submitted and running now (in skyblue backgroud)
